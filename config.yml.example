# === Layout Templates (OPTIONAL - Advanced Feature) ===
# Define custom layouts for different display modes and panel configurations
# If not specified, the system uses smart defaults optimized for dual 20×64 panels
#
# Use layout templates to customize element positioning for different panel sizes:
#   - Single 64×64 panel: More space for larger logos and text
#   - Single 32×16 panel: Need compact layouts
#   - Three+ panels: Can show more items simultaneously
#
# Each mode (sports, stocks) can have templates for different item counts:
#   - one_game / one_stock: Single item, full screen
#   - two_games / two_stocks: Two items, stacked or side-by-side
#   - three_games / four_stocks: Multiple compact items
#
# IMPORTANT: Coordinates are in pixels, origin (0,0) is top-left
# Colors can be: RGB tuples [R,G,B], or special names:
#   - "white", "black", "red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "orange", "cyan"
#   - "away_team", "home_team" (uses team colors)
#   - "change_color" (green/red based on stock direction)
#   - "time" (yellow for game clock/period)
